# EbagDigital

Welcome to Ebag Digital, a website to find information and other websites I have created check it out!

This project was created with `create-react-app` and I started off by stripping away the previous logos and code. I then switched the routes in my `index.html` and `manifest.json` files to use only 1 logo. I'm choosing to keep the `CRA` readme in the project folder for ease of use for other potential clients to reference. This gave me a clean slate to start with so I started story boarding what I wanted the site to look like.

After spending to much time deciding on a cool opening animation and finishing my inital storyboards I started working on the Navbar component. I decided it would be best to start top to bottom and the Navbar will be the one consistent thing on the page. It should have 3 tabs that link to another page, one for how to Contact me, one for an about me and another for previous work. One cool new thing I learned was to import Google Fonts into your React app, you just need to copy and paste the @import link they give you into your css sheet and thats it!
